BACKGROUND O
: O
An O

of O
reports O
indicate O
symptomatic O
relief O
of O
biliary O

after O
cholecystectomy T
for O
biliary D

Despite O
this O
, O
cholecystectomy T
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
biliary D
dyskinesia D
remains O
controversial O

Our O
aim O
was O
to O
determine O
efficacy O
of O
cholecystectomy T
in O
alleviating O
biliary D
dyskinesia D
symptoms D
and O
the O
correlation O
with O
histologic O
findings O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Biliary D
dyskinesia D
patients O
who O
underwent O
cholecystectomy T
had O
significantly O
greater O
symptom O
improvement O
compared O
with O
nonsurgical O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
This O

METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS O
: O
From O

a O
total O

90 O

The O
lesion D
was O
resected O
by O
video-assisted T

because O
it O
was O
suspected O
of O
being O
a O
lung O

that O
had O
caused O
repeated O

In O
this O

we O
investigated O
the O

potential O
of O
TRAIL T

the O

This O

whether O

: O
Inhaled O

have O
beneficial O

on O

in O
patients O

, O
but O
they O

We O

only O
a O

Thus O

when O

Therefore O

Because O
the O

we O
